# or whose result is not in the tree afterwards, fails the build: a driver without the fix must
# not be zipped. When Mesa upstream carries a fix, delete the patch here (see SOURCE).

# Max's WinNative series (patches/a8xx-winnative/0001-0006: mesh shaders, wave32, A8xx hang fixes)
# goes on the A8xx driver only. Mesh shaders and wave32 also switch on for A7xx (and wave32 for
# A6xx gen4), where they can steer DX12 games onto slower emulated paths, so the A6xx/A7xx drivers
# carry none of it. The A8xx driver is the one whose EXTRA_PATCH is the gen8 stack.
#
# As of 2026-10-08 this series is Max's 0001-0006 and nothing else: both KGSL bugs we used to
# patch ourselves are in Mesa main (see SOURCE), so the A6xx/A7xx series is empty and this layer
# no longer guards that driver. Add a patch here when Mesa has the bug and we do not.
